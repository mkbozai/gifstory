# GIFStory
GIFStory is an application that allows people to share their favorite memes and explain what they mean and where that content originally came from. If you've ever been confused as to where a popular meme came from, this is your place to find answers while also sharing your knowledge with the world too!

## Next Steps
1. I'd love to renovate the entire style of the application. Don't love the way the content lays right now

2. Allow Users to create a profile page so they can share whatever information about themselves as they want.

3. Install a gif api so users can search for content on the app itself, rather that extracting a link from somewhere else

4. Allow users to upload images from their own files.

5. Create a score system to track who posts often and also who shares accurate information.

6. Sort all the memes into categories

7. Add timestamps when you create posts so we can display all posts based on date uploaded.
